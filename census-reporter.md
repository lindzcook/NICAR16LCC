First stop for exploring U.S. Census and American Community Survey data.
Can give you basic facts about a place very quickly.
Or be a starting place for a deeper story.

## Ways to explore:

* By place search
* By topic search
* Guided topics

### Guided Topics
Found on the homepage, these topics explain Census and ACS tables and provide direct links to CensusReporter summaries for many tables.

* [Getting Started](http://censusreporter.org/topics/getting-started/)
* [Table Codes](http://censusreporter.org/topics/table-codes/)
* [Geography](http://censusreporter.org/topics/geography/)

These three are an introduction to the rest. Getting Started is a basic overview of the data. Table Codes serves as sort of codebook for deciphering what the codenumbers mean. Geography explains how the Census breaks down and denotes geography within tables.

* [Age and Sex](http://censusreporter.org/topics/age-sex/)
* [Children](http://censusreporter.org/topics/children/)
* [Commute](http://censusreporter.org/topics/commute/)
* [Employment](http://censusreporter.org/topics/employment/)
* [Families](http://censusreporter.org/topics/families/)
* [Health Insurance](http://censusreporter.org/topics/health-insurance/)
* [Income](http://censusreporter.org/topics/income/)
* [Migration](http://censusreporter.org/topics/migration/)
* [Poverty](http://censusreporter.org/topics/poverty/)
* [Public Assistance](http://censusreporter.org/topics/public-assistance/)
* [Race and Hispanic Origin](http://censusreporter.org/topics/race-hispanic/)
* [Same-sex Couples](http://censusreporter.org/topics/same-sex/)
* [Seniors](http://censusreporter.org/topics/seniors/)
* [Veterans and Military](http://censusreporter.org/topics/veterans/)

The rest of these describe the topics in more detail as well as list many tables that pertain to the topic. They're a great way to get started if you're just exploring data.

### Topic Search

Also available from the homepage is topic search. You can start typing words relating to tables that you're interested in, and a dropdown list will show you what's available.

### What you get

With either of these methods, you'll get a page describing the table. Helpfully, you'll get the universe of the table, to see who is included in the data. You'll also see the columns available. Off to the right are links to the topic pages that are relevant.

Most importantly, at the top is a box to pick the geographies you want to look at. You can either type a place name or a "summary level" â€” meaning a type of geography, like state, county, place, etc.

If you choose a summary level you'll also be asked to choose another, larger, summary level to filter the first choice by. An example: If you choose "places", you can then filter to choose places *in* Missouri, or places *in* St. Louis County.

#### The table view

Once you've chosen your places and clicked through, you'll get a table. Here's its anatomy:

* At the top, you have the dataset used (usually ACS, with 1-, 3- or 5-year noted)
* Below that, the table universe.
* Across the top of the table, in columns, you have the geographies you selected.
* Down the sides, you have the "columns" of categories in the table.
* The data, with margins of error, are in the appropriate spots.

A few tools are available to you on this page. On the left you can change what geographies you're looking at. At the top right, you can download the data into various formats, including GeoJSON or shapefiles.

Finally, in the green buttons near the top, you can view the data in two other ways: A map or a distribution.
