First stop for exploring U.S. Census and American Community Survey data.
Can give you basic facts about a place very quickly.
Or be a starting place for a deeper story.

## Ways to explore:

* By place search
* By topic search
* Guided topics

### Guided Topics
Found on the homepage, these topics explain Census and ACS tables and provide direct links to CensusReporter summaries for many tables.

* [Getting Started](http://censusreporter.org/topics/getting-started/)
* [Table Codes](http://censusreporter.org/topics/table-codes/)
* [Geography](http://censusreporter.org/topics/geography/)

These three are an introduction to the rest. Getting Started is a basic overview of the data. Table Codes serves as sort of codebook for deciphering what the codenumbers mean. Geography explains how the Census breaks down and denotes geography within tables.
